# Movie Collection Website
This is a Python code that generates an HTML document based on a array of movies. All movies are objects/instances created from the Movie class defined on the media.py file

The final (HTML) document provides detailed info on each movie and also a link to their Trailers.

## SET UP
In order to customize and run this code, you must ensure that Python (ver 2.7 or newer) is installed on your computer. The following steps will guide your through the customization process:

1. With your IDE of choice, open entertainment_center.py
2. Replace/create movie instances with your favorite movies, providing all the necessary variables.
3. Update the movie array at the end of the code.
4. Run entertainment_center.py

## CUSTOMIZING THE FINAL HTML
All changes related to CSS and the HTML structure have to be made in the fresh_tomatoes.py file.

## THINGS TO IMPROVE
* Integrate with an external API (OMDB or TMDB)
* Improve html aceesibility
* Write CSS and JS into separate files
